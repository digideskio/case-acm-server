# case-acm-server
Code and issues for the ACM docker server

For now, is to collect issues and TODOs with the docker VM on the CRWU ACM server.  
It will eventually also host the code used to glue together docker, docker-compose, the 
required networking hacks needed to work with Case's IT infrastructure, and whatever else 
ends up needing done.
